# Prompt History Record: VLA Module Task Generation

## Original Prompt

```
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Response Summary

Created comprehensive task list for the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) module implementation. The tasks.md file includes 37 specific, actionable tasks organized across 6 phases:

1. Phase 1: Setup (6 tasks) - Project initialization and environment setup
2. Phase 2: Foundational (5 tasks) - Core module structure and navigation
3. Phase 3: User Story 1 (5 tasks) - Voice-to-Action chapter implementation
4. Phase 4: User Story 2 (5 tasks) - Cognitive Planning with LLMs chapter
5. Phase 5: User Story 3 (7 tasks) - Capstone Autonomous Humanoid chapter
6. Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting (11 tasks) - Quality assurance and deployment

Each task follows the required checklist format with proper IDs, story labels where applicable, and specific file paths. The implementation strategy emphasizes progressive delivery with User Story 1 as the MVP. Dependencies and parallel execution opportunities are clearly identified.

## Outcome

Successfully generated a complete task list that enables systematic implementation of the VLA module. The tasks are structured to deliver value incrementally while maintaining technical and educational coherence.

## Evaluation

The task generation successfully meets all requirements:
- All tasks follow the required checklist format
- User stories are properly organized with independent test criteria
- Dependencies are clearly identified
- Parallel execution opportunities are noted
- Each task is specific enough for implementation without additional context
- Tasks align with the feature specification and implementation plan
