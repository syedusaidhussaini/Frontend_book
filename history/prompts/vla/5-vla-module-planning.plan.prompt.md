# Prompt History Record: VLA Module Planning

## Original Prompt

```
Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

1. Create Module-4 folder in Docusaurus docs and add all chapter `.md` files.
2. Write conceptual content for each chapter and connect them via Docusaurus sidebar.
3. Verify local build and navigation for Module-4 pages.
```

## Response Summary

Created a comprehensive implementation plan for the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) module, including:

1. Implementation Plan (plan.md) - Detailed technical approach with constitution check
2. Research Summary (research.md) - Addressed technical clarifications needed
3. Data Model (data-model.md) - Defined entities and relationships for the module
4. Quickstart Guide (quickstart.md) - Step-by-step implementation guide
5. Contracts Directory - Placeholder for API contracts (not needed for this content-only feature)

The plan follows the Spec-Driven Development approach and aligns with the project constitution. It addresses the creation of educational content covering voice-to-action systems, LLM-based cognitive planning, and complete autonomous humanoid integration. All content will be structured in Markdown format for the Docusaurus documentation system.

## Outcome

Successfully created a complete implementation plan for the VLA module that follows the project's constitution and technical requirements. The plan includes all necessary documentation for implementing the three-chapter module on Vision-Language-Action systems for humanoid robots.

## Evaluation

The implementation plan successfully addresses all requirements:
- Creates proper directory structure for Docusaurus
- Defines content structure for three chapters
- Ensures proper navigation and integration with existing modules
- Follows the project constitution and technical standards
- Provides clear guidance for implementation
